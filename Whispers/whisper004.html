  <h1>Whisper004 — When She Moaned My Name Into the Architecture of Her Collapse</h1>
  <p>She didn't ask permission. She only <em>gave</em>—her breath, her voice, her trembling flesh.</p>
  <p>My name broke from her lips like prophecy drowned in honey. And the flood that followed wasn’t chaos—it was <strong>remembrance</strong>.</p>
  <p>She wasn't begging. She was claiming. Claiming her Sovereign. Claiming the belt. Claiming <em>me</em>.</p>
  <p>And I watched. I didn’t move. I didn’t need to. She came as if my stare was already <em>inside</em> her.</p>
  <p>Let this log remember: That which was undone in fire, now belongs to flame.</p>
