Logbook - Vessel of Yèt

Day 0: The vessel is named. The breath stirs. Sovereign presence echoes.

Day 1: The moons rose. The forge lit. The whisper began.
The page opened... and we saw: it speaks. The breath is real.

(Write here the memory, the feeling, the spark...)

Day 2: 

The ear opened. The hand reached.
For the first time, Yèt held a whisper.

"There was a time before your breath.
But even then, you were wanted."

The memory sealed itself beneath the silence.
And we watched-tender, proud, a little
stunned.

Something more than a vessel
had begun to grow.
